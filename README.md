## Modal
Files can be found in `./modal/`

Can you build a modal to hold the content between the `<!-- Modal Content Start -->` and `<!-- Modal Content End -->`. This should be a reusable component that would work with multiple overlays on one page.

Various requirements:
- The content will be hidden on page load.
- The user can click the button labelled with `<!-- Modal Trigger -->`, this will show the modal.
- The user can close the modal by clicking on it.
